# Automatic-Number-Plate-Recognition


Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) is a highly accurate system capable of reading vehicle number plates without human intervention Through the use of high speed image capture with supporting illumination, detection of characters within the images provided, verification of the character sequences as being those from a vehicle license plate, character recognition to convert image to text; so ending up with a set of metadata that identifies an image containing a vehicle license plate and the associated decoded text of that plate.

ANPR is therefore the underlying technology used to find a vehicle license/number plate and it, in turn, supplies this information to a next stage of computer processing through which the information can be interpreted, stored or matched to create an ANPR based application.
